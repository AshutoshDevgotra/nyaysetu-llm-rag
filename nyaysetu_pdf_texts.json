The meaning of the endorsement, as explained by \nmercantile usage, is that the bill is to be paid to the holder. The endorsement is a document, and must be construed in the same \nmanner as if the words “pay to the holder” or words to that effect had been written over the signature. \n2[29A. “Electronic record”.—The words “electronic record” shall have the meaning assigned to \nthem in clause (t) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of 2000).] \n30. “Valuable security”.—The words “valuable security” denote a document which is, or purports to \nbe, a document whereby any legal right is created, extended, transferred, restricted, extinguished or \n                                                           \n1.

As the effect of this endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any \nperson who may become the unlawful holder of it, the endorsement is a “valuable security”.  \n31. “A will”.—The words “a will” denote any testamentary document. \n32. Words referring to acts include illegal omissions.—In every part of this Code, except where a \ncontrary intention appears from the context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal \nomissions. \n33. “Act”. “Omission”.—The word “act” denotes as well as series of acts as a single act: the word \n“omission” denotes as well a series of omissions as a single omission.  \n1[34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.—When a criminal act is \ndone by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for \nthat act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.] \n35. When such an act is criminal by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or \nintention.—Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal \nknowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such \nknowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with \nthat knowledge or intention. \n36. Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission.—Wherever the causing of a certain effect, \nor an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the \ncausing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. \nIllustration \nA intentionally causes Z's death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and party by beating Z. A has committed \nmurder. \n37. Co-operation by doing one of several acts constituting an offence.—When an offence is \ncommitted by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence \nby doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. \nIllustrations \n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the \npoison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to \nhim. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is \ncaused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. \n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, \nintending to cause Z's death, knowingly co-operate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his \nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of \nZ. \n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in \nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from \nhis office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that \nhe is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty \nonly of an attempt to commit murder. \n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several \npersons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different \noffences by means of that act. \nIllustration \nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only culpable homicide not \namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, \nassists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of \nculpable homicide. \n                                                           \n1. Subs. by Act 27 of 1870, s. 1, for section 34. \n\n20 \n \n39. “Voluntarily”.—A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by means \nwhereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing those means, he knew or \nhad reason to believe to be likely to cause it. \nIllustration \nA sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death \nof a person. Here, A may not have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he \nknew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily. \n1[40. “Offence”.—Except in the 2[Chapters] and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this section, \nthe word “offence” denotes a thing made punishable by this Code. \nIn Chapter IV, 3[Chapter VA] and in the following sections, namely, sections 4[64, 65, 66, 5[67], 71], \n109, 110, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117,6[118, 119 and 120] 187, 194, 195, 203, 211, 213, 214, 221, 222, 223, \n224, 225, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 347, 348, 388, 389 and 445, the word “offence” denotes a thing \npunishable under this Code, or under any special or local law as hereinafter defined. \nAnd in sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441, the word “offence” has the same meaning \nwhen the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with imprisonment \nfor a term of six months or upwards, whether with or without fine.]  \n41. “Special law”.—A “special law” is a law applicable to a particular subject. \n42. “Local law”.—A “local law” is a law applicable only to a particular part of 7[8***9[India]]. \n43. “Illegal”. “Legally bound to do”.—The word “illegal” is applicable to everything which is an \noffence or which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action; and a person is said to \nbe “legally bound to do” whatever it is illegal in him to omit. \n44. “Injury”.—The word “injury” denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in \nbody, mind, reputation or property. \n45. “Life”.—The word “life” denotes the life of a human being, unless the contrary appears from the \ncontext. \n46. “Death”.—The word “death” denotes the death of a human being unless the contrary appears \nfrom the context. \n47. “Animal”.—The word “animal” denotes any living creature, other than a human being. \n48. “Vessel”.—The word “vessel” denotes anything made for the conveyance by water of human \nbeings or of property. \n49. “Year”. “Month”.—Wherever the word “year” or the word “month” is used, it is to be \nunderstood that the year or the month is to be reckoned according to the British calendar. \n50. “Section”.—The word “section” denotes one of those portions of a Chapter of this Code which \nare distinguished by prefixed numeral figures. \n51. “Oath”.—The word “oath” includes a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath, and any \ndeclaration required or authorised by law to be made before a public servant or to be used for the purpose \nof proof, whether in a Court of Justice or not. \n52. “Good faith”.—Nothing is said to be done or believed in “good faith” which is done or believed \nwithout due care and attention. \n                                                           \n1.

Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \nof fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in \ndoing it. \nIllustration \nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of \nthe power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper \nauthorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \nmeans and with proper care and caution. \nIllustration \nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper \ncaution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \n81. Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.—\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause \nharm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of \npreventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. \nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that \nit was likely to cause harm. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a \nposition that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, \nunless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with \nonly two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of \nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \nimminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. \n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \nseven years of age.  \n83. Act of a child above seven and under twelve of immature understanding.—Nothing is an \noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained \nsufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that \noccasion. \n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that \nhe is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \nincapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to  \nlaw: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or \nagainst his will. \n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—\nIn cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person \nwho does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge \nas he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was \nadministered to him without his knowledge or against his will. \n\n26 \n \n87. Act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by \nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \nwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \nIllustration \nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm \nwhich, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no \noffence. \n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person's benefit.—\nNothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or \nbe intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose \nbenefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that \nharm, or to take the risk of that harm. \nIllustration \nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \nbut not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A \nhas committed no offence. \n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause \nor be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \nattempting to cause death; \nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing \nit knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous \nhurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \nof which offence it would not extend. \nIllustration \nA, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \nbe likely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception,  \ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as \nis intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent \nwas given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \nwho is under twelve years of age. \n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in \nsections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they \nmay cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or \non whose behalf the consent is given. \n\n27 \n \nIllustration \nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently \nof any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; \nand the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \n92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by \nreason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without \nthat person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, \nor if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of \nhim from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or the \nattempting to cause death; \nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \nwhich offence it would not extend. \nIllustrations \n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's \ndeath, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed \nno offence. \n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \nand in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \nThere is not time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in \ngood faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence. \n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the housestop, \nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's \nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \nIllustration \nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death. \n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by \nthreats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person \nwill otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a \nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \nhe became subject to such constraint. \nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a \ngang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of \nhis having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \n\n28 \n \n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of \nordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. \nOf the Right of Private Defence \n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the \nright of private defence. \n97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human \nbody; \nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \nany act which is an offence falling under the defintion of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, \nwhich would otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of \nmaturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by \nreason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence \nagainst that act which he would have if the act were that offence. \nIllustrations \n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private \ndefence which he would have if Z were sane. \n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, \nwhich he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of \nthe public authorities. \nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \nExplanation 1.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or \nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the \nperson doing the act is such public servant. \nExplanation 2.—A person is not deprived of the right of private defence against an act done, or \nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of \nprivate defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the \nvoluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the \nexercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \nFirst.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the \nconsequence of such assault; \n\n29 \n \nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will \notherwise be the consequence of such assault; \nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities \nfor his release. \n1[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid \nwhich may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of \nsuch act.] \n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of \nany of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body \ndoes not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions \nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of \nprivate defence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary \ncausing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the \nattempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions \nhereinafter enumerated, namely:— \nFirst.—Robbery; \nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \nFourthly.—Theft, mischief, or house-trespass, under such circumstances as may reasonably cause \napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \nexercised. \n104. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence, the \ncommitting of which, or the attempting to commit which occasions the exercise of the right of private \ndefence, be theft, mischief, or criminal trespass, not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last \npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other \nthan death. \n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \nprivate defence of property commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property \ncommences. \nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \nwith the property or either the assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or the property has been \nrecovered. \nThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \n                                                           \n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \n\n30 \n \nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the \nhouse-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \n106. Right of private defence against deadly assault when there is risk of harm to innocent \nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without \nrisk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \nIllustration \nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if \nby so firing he harms any of the children. \nCHAPTER V \nOF ABETMENT \n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \nthat thing; or \nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \nIllustration \nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \napprehension of C. \nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \nthe doing of that act. \n108. Abettor.—A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the \ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although \nthe abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should \nbe committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \nIllustrations \n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of \ninstigating B to commit murder. \nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \nintention or knowledge. \n \n \n\n31 \n \nIllustrations \n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a \nperson capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or \nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. \n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. \nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable \nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \nthe punishment provided for that offence. \n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A \ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \nproperty. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of \nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \nalso an offence. \nIllustration \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in \nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B \nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \nIllustration \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C \nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \nprocures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in \nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \n1[108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the \nmeaning of this Code who, in 2[India], abets the commission of any act without and beyond 2[India] \nwhich would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. \nIllustration \nA, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no \nexpress provision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is \ncommitted in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the \npunishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \nExplanation.—An act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is \ncommitted in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which \nconstitutes the abetment. \nIllustrations \n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B \naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \n                                                           \n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., \nto read as above. \n\n32 \n \n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z's \ndeath. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \n110. Punishment of abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of \nabettor.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a \ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for \nthe offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge \nof the abettor and with no other. \n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted \nand a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent \nas if he had directly abetted it: \nProvided the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the \ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the \nabetment. \nIllustrations \n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the \nside of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was \nunder the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to \nthe same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house. B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of \nthe inmates, murder Z.

A has given false evidence. \n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when \nhe does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false \nevidence. \n\n50 \n \n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of \nZ; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, \nalthough the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. \n(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not \nknowing anything upon the subject.

A has fabricated false evidence. \n(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has \nfabricated false evidence. \n(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting, \npurporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the \nofficers of the police are likely to search.

As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A as given false evidence. \nExplanation 3.—An investigation directed by a Court of Justice according to law, and conducted \nunder the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may \nnot take place before a Court of Justice. \nIllustration \nA, in an enquiry before an officer deputed by a Court of Justice to ascertain on the spot the boundaries of land, makes on \noath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence. \n194.

Using as true such declaration knowing it to be false.—Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to \nuse as true any such declaration, knowing the same to be false in any material point, shall be punished in \nthe same manner as if he gave false evidence. \nExplanation.—A declaration which is inadmissible merely upon the ground of some informality, is a \ndeclaration within the meaning of sections 199 and 200. \n201.

Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing \ndeath, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the \nknowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \nIllustrations \n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. \nHere, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause \ndeath by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \nExplanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, \ndisease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused \nhis death. \nExplanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury \nshall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment \nthe death might have been prevented. \nExplanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may \namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \n300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be \nlikely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \n3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury \nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without \nany excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \nIllustrations \n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. \n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, \nalthough he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \n\n70 \n \nException 1.—When culpable homicide is not murder.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for \nkilling or doing harm to any person. \nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \nprivate defence. \nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \namounting to murder is a question of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \nhomicide. \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \n(e)A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the \nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and \nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \nIllustration \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is \ncaused. \nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue \nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \nassault. \nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \n \n \n\n71 \n \nIllustration \nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's \nyouth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \n301. Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was \nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, \ncommits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows \nhimself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of \nwhich it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew \nhimself to he likely to cause. \n302. Punishment for murder.—Whoever commits murder shall be punished with death or \n1[imprisonment for life], and shall also be liable to fine. \n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of 1[imprisonment \nfor life], commits murder, shall be punished with death. \n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \nhomicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with 1[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of \neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as \nis likely to cause death; \nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or \nwith both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention \nto cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. \n2[304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash \nor negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either \ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.] \n3[304B. Dowry death.—(1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or \noccurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that \nsoon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her \nhusband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called “dowry death”, and \nsuch husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death. \nExplanation.—For the purposes of this sub-section, “dowry” shall have the same meaning as in \nsection 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961). \n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be \nless than seven years but which may extend to imprisonment for life.] \n305. Abetment of suicide of child or insane person.—If any person under eighteen years of age, \nany insane person, any delirious person, any idiot, or any person in a state of intoxication, commits \nsuicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be punished with death or 1[imprisonment \nfor life], or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. \n306.

A is \nliable to punishment under this section. \n(b) A, with the intention of causing the death of a child of tender years, exposes it in a desert place A has committed the \noffence defined by this section, though the death of the child does not ensue. \n(c) A, intending to murder Z, buys a gun and loads it. A has not yet committed the offence. A fires the gun at Z. He has \ncommitted the offence defined in this section, and, if by such firing he wounds Z, he is liable to the punishment provided by the  \n latter part of 2[the first paragraph of] this section. \n(d) A, intending to murder Z by poison, purchases poison and mixes the same with food which remains in A's keeping; A \nhas not yet committed the offence defined in this section.

Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent, \nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \nIllustrations \n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \nproduced without any other action on any person's part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so \nwithout Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will \ncause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's \nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \nwithout Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring \nit into contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent, intending or \nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's \nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried \nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A \nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal \nforce to Z. \n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \nmust affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent \nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \ncriminal force to Z. \n351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that \ngesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \nassault. \nIllustrations \n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \nZ. A has committed an assault. \n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by \nthat person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to \nthree months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \n\n79 \n \nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \nthis section, if the provocation is sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the \noffence, or \nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \n353.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \nany person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \ntheft. \nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented \nit from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be \ngiven either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express \nor implied. \nIllustrations \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's \nconsent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the \ndog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may \ndishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \n(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's \nconsent. A has committed theft. \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \n                                                           \n1. Subs. by Act 22 of 2018, s. 7, for “section 376D” (w.e.f. 21-4-2018).  \n2. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \n\n89 \n \nintention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the \nring, commits theft. \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he \nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed \ntheft. \n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \n379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either \ndescription for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. \n380. Theft in dwelling house, etc.—Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel, which \nbuilding, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for the custody of property, shall be punished \nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be \nliable to fine. \n381. Theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master.—Whoever, being a clerk or \nservant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property \nin the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for \na term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.  \n382. Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the \ncommitting of the theft.—Whoever commits theft, having made preparation for causing death, or hurt, \nor restraint, or fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such \ntheft, or in order to the effecting of his escape after the committing of such theft, or in order to the \nretaining of property taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which \nmay extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. \n \n Illustrations \n(a) A commits theft on property in Z's possession; and while committing this theft, he has a loaded pistol under his garment, \nhaving provided this pistol for the purpose of hurting Z in case Z should resist. A has committed the offence defined in this \nsection. \n(b) A picks Z's pocket, having posted several of his companions near him, in order that they may restrain Z, if Z should \nperceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A. A has committed the offence defined in this section. \nOf Extortion \n383. Extortion.—Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any \nother, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property, or \nvaluable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits \n“extortion”. \nIllustrations \n(a) A threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning Z unless Z gives him money. He thus induces Z to give him money. \nA has committed extortion. \n\n90 \n \n(b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z's child in wrongful confinement, unless Z will sign and deliver to A a promissory note \nbinding Z to pay certain monies to A. Z sings and delivers the note. A has committed extortion. \n(c) A threatens to send club-men to plough up Z's field unless Z will sign and deliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty \nto deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the bond. A has committed extortion. \n(d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank paper and deliver it to \nA. Z sings and delivers the paper to A. Here, as the paper so signed may be converted into a valuable security. A has committed \nextortion. \n384. Punishment for extortion.—Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment \nof either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. \n385. Putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion.—Whoever, in order to the \ncommitting of extortion, puts any person in fear, or attempts to put any person in fear, of any injury, shall \nbe punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with \nfine, or with both. \n386.

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \n\n91 \n \nIllustrations \n(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z's money and jewels from Z's clothes, without Z's consent. Here A has \ncommitted theft, and, in order to the committing of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A has therefore \ncommitted robbery. \n(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has \nextorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. \nA has therefore committed robbery. \n(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers \nhis purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to \nthe child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. \n(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us \nten thousand rupees”.

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property \nto his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \nconsent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has \nnot committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his \nown use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \nExplanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning \nof this section. \nIllustration \nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement.

Here A has not \ncommitted the offence defined in this section. \n(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the \nnote belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \n                                                           \n1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \n\n93 \n \n(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of \nthe person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque \nwas drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \n(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards \nappropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. \n(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and \nappropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. \n(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the \nowner.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and \nmakes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \n(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the \nintention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. \nA fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill \nup the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently \nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill \nwith a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by \nleading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \n(f) Z's will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A \ndishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed \nforgery. \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay \nto Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the \nspecial endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. \n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same \nestate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the \nestate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has \nprepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in \ndistressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. \nHere, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain \nemployment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to \ninduce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. \nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \nIllustrations \n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person \nof the same name. A has committed forgery. \n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the \npaper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; \nand if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own \nname, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed \nforgery. \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, \nexecutes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with \nintent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in \nhis own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; \nand in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, \nand antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has \ncommitted forgery under the first head of the definition. \nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be \nbelieved that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to \nbe believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery. \n \n \n\n103 \n \nIllustration \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with \nintent to negotiate it.

Procedure to be followed when there is a complaint case and police investigation in respect \nof the same offence.—(1) When in a case instituted otherwise than on a police report (hereinafter \nreferred to as a complaint case), it is made to appear to the Magistrate, during the course of the inquiry or \ntrial held by him, that an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the \nsubject-matter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall stay the proceedings of such inquiry \nor trial and call for a report on the matter from the police officer conducting the investigation. \n(2) If a report is made by the investigating police officer under section 173 and on such report \n                                                 \n1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 19, for clause (a) (w.e.f. 18-12-1978). \n\n107 \n \ncognizance of any offence is taken by the Magistrate against any person who is an accused in the \ncomplaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case and the case arising out \nof the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a police report. \n(3) If the police report does not relate to any accused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate does \nnot take cognizance of any offence on the police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or trial, which \nwas stayed by him, in accordance with the provisions of this Code. \nCHAPTER XVII \nTHE CHARGE \nA.—Form of charges \n211. Contents of charge.—(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the \naccused is charged. \n (2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in \nthe charge by that name only. \n(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition \nof the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. \n(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be \nmentioned in the charge. \n(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by \nlaw to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. \n(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court. \n(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such \nprevious conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent \noffence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment \nwhich the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous \nconviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at \nany time before sentence is passed. \nIllustrations \n(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder \ngiven in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions \nof the said Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or that, if it did fall within \nException 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception applied to it. \n(b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B \nby means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 \nof the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it. \n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark. \nThe charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or \nthat he used a false property-mark, without reference to the definitions, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code \n(45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance be referred to in the charge. \n(d) A is charged under section 184 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with intentionally obstructing a sale of \nproperty offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words. \n212. Particulars as to time, place and person.—(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to \nthe time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any) in \n\n108 \n \nrespect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter \nwith which he is charged. \n(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money \nor other movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, describe \nthe movable property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates \nbetween which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact \ndates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of \nsection 219: \nProvided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year. \n213. When manner of committing offence must be stated.—When the nature of the case is such \nthat the particulars mentioned in sections 211 and 212 do not give the accused sufficient notice of the \nmatter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the \nalleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose. \nIllustrations \n(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in \nwhich the theft was effected. \n(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B. \n (c) A is accused of giving false evidence at a given time and place. The charge must set out that portion of the \nevidence given by A which is alleged to be false. \n(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place. \nThe charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B in the discharge of his functions. \n(e) A is accused of the murder of B at a given time and place. The charge need not state the manner in which A \nmurdered B. \n(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge must set out the \ndisobedience charged and the law infringed. \n214. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable.—In every charge \nwords used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to them \nrespectively by the law under which such offence is punishable. \n215. Effect of errors.— No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated \nin the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any  stage of \nthe case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has \noccasioned a failure of justice. \nIllustrations \n(a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with “having been in possession of \ncounterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit,” the word \n“fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not \nbe regarded as material. \n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out \nincorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this \nthat the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material. \n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many \n\n109 \n \ntransactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no \ndefence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a \nmaterial error. \n(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was \nHaidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and \nhad heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer \nfrom these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial. \n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him \nfor that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of \nKhoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from \nthis that A was misled, and that the error was material. \n216. Court may alter charge.—(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before \njudgment is pronounced. \n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused. \n(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not \nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct \nof the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with \nthe trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge. \n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the \nopinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a \nnew trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. \n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous \nsanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction \nhas been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added \ncharge is founded. \n217. Recall of witnesses when charge altered.—Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the \nCourt after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed— \n(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness \nwho may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that \nthe prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the \npurpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice; \n(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material. \nB.—Joinder of charges \n218. Separate charges for distinct offences.—(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is \naccused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately: \nProvided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is \nof opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or \nany number of the charges framed against such person. \n(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of sections 219, 220, 221 \nand 223. \n\n110 \n \nIllustration \nA is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. A must be separately charged and \nseparately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt. \n219. Three offences of same kind within year may be charged together.—(1) When a person is \naccused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from \nthe first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, \nand tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three. \n(2) Offences are of the same kind when they are punishable with the same amount of punishment \nunder the same section of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local law: \nProvided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under section 379 of the Indian \nPenal Code (45 of 1860) shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an offence punishable \nunder section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or \nof any special or local law, shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit \nsuch offence, when such an attempt is an offence. \n220. Trial for more than one offence.—(1) If, in one series of acts so connected together as to form \nthe same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, \nand tried at one trial for, every such offence. \n(2) When a person charged with one or more offences of criminal breach of trust or dishonest \nmisappropriation of property as provided in sub-section (2) of section 212 or in sub-section (1) of section \n219, is accused of committing, for the purpose of facilitating or concealing the commission of that offence \nor those offences, one or more offences of falsification of accounts, he may be charged with, and tried at \none trial for, every such offence. \n(3) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law \nin force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them may be \ncharged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. \n(4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, \nconstitute when combined a different offence, the person accused of them may be charged with, and tried \nat one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined, and for any offence constituted by \nany one, or more, of such acts. \n(5) Nothing contained in this section shall affect section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \nIllustrations to sub-section (1) \n(a) A rescues B, a person in lawful custody, and in so doing causes grievous hurt to C, a constable in whose custody B \nwas. A may be charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 225 and 333 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \n(b) A commits house-breaking by day with intent to commit adultery, and commits, in the house so entered, adultery \nwith B's wife. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 454 and 497 of the Indian Penal \nCode (45 of 1860). \n(c) A entices B, the wife of C, away from C, with intent to commit adultery with B, and then commits adultery with \nher. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 498 and 497 of the Indian Penal Code         \n(45 of 1860). \n(d) A has in his possession several seals, knowing them to be counterfeit and intending to use them for the purpose of \ncommitting several forgeries punishable under section 466 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). A may be separately \n\n111 \n \ncharged with, and convicted of, the possession of each seal under section 473 of the Indian Penal Code. \n(e) With intent to cause injury to B, A institutes a criminal proceeding against him, knowing that there is no just or \nlawful ground for such proceeding, and also falsely accuses B of having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just \nor lawful ground for such charge. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, two offences under section 211 of the \nIndian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \n(f) A, with intent to cause injury to B, falsely accuses him of having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just \nor lawful ground for such charge. On the trial, A gives false evidence against B, intending thereby to cause B to be \nconvicted of a capital offence. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 211 and 194 of \nthe Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \n(g) A, with six others, commits the offences of rioting, grievous hurt and assaulting a public servant endeavouring in \nthe discharge of his duty as such to suppress the riot. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under \nsections 147, 325 and 152 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \n (h) A threatens B, C and D at the same time with injury to their persons with intent to cause alarm to them. A may be \nseparately charged with, and convicted of, each of the three offences under section 506 of the Indian Penal Code                         \n(45 of 1860). \nThe separate charges referred to in illustrations (a) to (h), respectively, may be tried at the same time. \nIllustrations to sub-section (3) \n(i) A wrongfully strikes B with a cane.

The child dies in consequence of \nsuch exposure. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences under sections 317 and 304 of the Indian Penal \nCode (45 of 1860). \n(l) A dishonestly uses a forged document as genuine evidence, in order to convict B, a public servant, of an offence \nunder section 167 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, offences \nunder sections 471 (read with section 466) and 196 of that Code. \nIllustration to sub-section (4) \n(m) A commits robbery on B, and in doing so voluntarily causes hurt to him. A may be separately charged with, and \nconvicted of, offences under sections 323, 392 and 394 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \n221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed.—(1) If a single act or series of acts is \nof such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, \nthe accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such \ncharges may be tried at once; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of \nthe said offences. \n(2) If in such a case the accused is charged with one offence, and it appears in evidence that he \ncommitted a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of sub-section \n(1), he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not \ncharged with it. \nIllustrations \n(a) A is accused of an act which may amount to theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal breach of trust or cheating. He \nmay be charged with theft, receiving stolen property, criminal breach of trust and cheating, or he may be charged with having \ncommitted theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal breach of trust or cheating. \n(b) In the case mentioned, A is only charged with theft. It appears that he committed the offence of criminal breach of trust, or \n\n112 \n \nthat of receiving stolen goods. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust or of receiving stolen goods (as the case may be), \nthough he was not charged with such offence. \n(c) A states on oath before the Magistrate that he saw B hit C with a club. Before the Sessions Court A states on oath that B \nnever hit C. A may be charged in the alternative and convicted of  intentionally giving false evidence, although it cannot be proved \nwhich of these contradictory statements was false. \n222. When offence proved included in offence charged.—(1) When a person is charged with an \noffence consisting of several particulars, a combination of some only of which constitutes a complete \nminor offence, and such combination is proved, but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be \nconvicted of the minor offence, though he was not charged with it. \n(2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence, \nhe may be convicted of the minor offence, although he is not charged with it. \n(3) When a person is charged with an offence, he may be convicted of an attempt to commit such \noffence although the attempt is not separately charged. \n(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a conviction of any minor offence where the \nconditions requisite for the initiation of proceedings in respect of that minor offence have not been \nsatisfied.  \nIllustrations \n(a) A is charged, under section 407 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with criminal breach of trust in respect of \nproperty entrusted to him as a carrier. It appears, that he did commit criminal breach of trust under section 406 of that Code \nin respect of the property, but that it was not entrusted to him as a carrier. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust \nunder the said section 406. \n(b) A is charged, under section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with causing grievous hurt.

Withdrawal of remaining charges on conviction on one of several charges.—When a charge \ncontaining more heads than one is framed against the same person, and when a conviction has been had \non one or more of them, the complainant, or the officer conducting the prosecution, may, with the consent \nof the Court, withdraw the remaining charge or charges, or the Court of its own accord may stay the \ninquiry into, or trial of, such charge or charges and such withdrawal shall have the effect of an acquittal \non such charge or charges, unless the conviction be set aside, in which case the said Court (subject to the \norder of the Court setting aside the conviction) may proceed with the inquiry into, or trial of, the charge or \ncharges so withdrawn. \nCHAPTER XVIII \nTRIAL BEFORE A COURT OF SESSION \n225. Trial to be conducted by Public Prosecutor.—In every trial before a Court of Session, the \nprosecution shall be conducted by a Public Prosecutor. \n226. Opening case for prosecution.—When the accused appears or is brought before the Court in \npursuance of a commitment of the case under section 209, the prosecutor shall open his case by \ndescribing the charge brought against the accused and stating by what evidence he proposes to prove the \nguilt of the accused. \n227. Discharge.—If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted \ntherewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge \nconsiders that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the \naccused and record his reasons for so doing. \n228.

Order for custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain cases.—When any property is \nproduced before any Criminal Court during any inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for \nthe proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the property is subject to \nspeedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it \nthinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of. \nExplanation.—For the purposes of this section, “property” includes— \n(a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the Court or which is in its custody; \n(b) any property regarding which an offence appears to have been committed or which appears to have \nbeen used for the commission of any offence. \n452. Order for disposal of property at conclusion of trial.—(1) When an inquiry or trial in any Criminal \nCourt is concluded, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal, by destruction, confiscation or \ndelivery to any person claiming to be entitled to possession thereof or otherwise, of any property or document \nproduced before it or in its custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed, or which has \nbeen used for the commission of any offence. \n(2) An order may be made under sub-section (1) for the delivery of any property to any person claiming to be \nentitled to the possession thereof, without any condition or on condition that he executes a bond, with or without \nsecurities, to the satisfaction of the Court, engaging to restore such property to the Court if the order made under \nsub-section (1) is modified or set aside on appeal or revision. \n(3) A Court of Session may, instead of itself making an order under sub-section (1), direct the property to be \ndelivered to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall thereupon deal with it in the manner provided in sections 457, \n458 and 459. \n(4) Except where the property is livestock or is subject to speedy and natural decay, or where a bond has been \nexecuted in pursuance of sub-section (2), an order made under sub-section (1) shall not be carried out for two \nmonths, or when an appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of. \n(5) In this section, the term “property” includes, in the case of property regarding which an offence appears to \nhave been committed, not only such property as has been originally in the possession or under the control of any \nparty, but also any property into or for which the same may have been converted or exchanged, and anything \nacquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or otherwise. \n453. Payment to innocent purchaser of money found on accused.—When any person is convicted of any \noffence which includes, or amounts to, theft or receiving stolen property, and it is proved that any other person \nbought the stolen property from him without knowing  or having reason to believe  that the same was stolen, and \nthat any money has on his arrest been taken out of the possession of the convicted person, the Court may, on the \napplication of such purchaser and on the restitution of the stolen property to the person entitled to the possession \nthereof, order that out of such money a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be delivered to him. \n454. Appeal against orders under section 452 or section 453.—(1) Any person aggrieved by an order made \nby a Court under section 452 or section 453, may appeal against it to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from \nconvictions by the former Court. \n(2) On such appeal, the Appellate Court may direct the order to be stayed pending disposal of the appeal, or \nmay modify, alter or annul the order and make any further orders that may be just. \n(3) The powers referred to in sub-section (2) may also be exercised by a Court of appeal, confirmation or \nrevision while dealing with the case in which the order referred to in sub-section (1) was made. \n455. Destruction of libellous and other matter.—(1) On a conviction under section 292, section 293, section \n501 or section 502 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the Court may order the destruction of all the copies of the \n\n189 \n \nthing in respect of which the conviction was had, and which are in the custody of the Court or remain in the \npossession or power of the person convicted. \n(2) The Court may, in like manner, on a conviction under section 272, section 273, section 274 or section 275 of \nthe Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), order the food, drink, drug or medical preparation in respect of which the \nconviction was had, to be destroyed. \n456. Power to restore possession of immovable property.—(1) When a person is convicted of an offence \nattended by criminal force or show of force or by criminal intimidation, and it appears to the Court that, by such \nforce or show of force or intimidation, any person has been dispossessed of any immovable property, the Court may, \nif it thinks fit, order that possession of the same be restored to that person after evicting by force, if necessary, any \nother person who may be in possession of the property: \nProvided that no such order shall be made by the Court more than one month after the date of the conviction. \n(2) Where the Court trying the offence has not made an order under sub-section (1), the Court of appeal, \nconfirmation or revision may, if it thinks fit, make such order while disposing of the appeal, reference or revision, as \nthe case may be. \n(3) Where an order has been made under sub-section (1), the provisions of section 454 shall apply in relation \nthereto as they apply in relation to an order under section 453. \n(4) No order made under  this section shall prejudice any right or interest to or in such immovable property \nwhich any person may be able to establish in a civil suit. \n457. Procedure by police upon seizure of property.—(1) Whenever the seizure of property by any police \nofficer is reported to a Magistrate under the provisions of this Code, and such property is not produced before a \nCriminal Court during an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate may make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal \nof such property or the delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, or if such person \ncannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of such property. \n(2) If the person so entitled is known, the Magistrate may order the property to be delivered to him on such \nconditions (if any) as the Magistrate thinks fit and if such person is unknown, the Magistrate may detain it and shall, \nin such case, issue a proclamation specifying the articles of which such property consists, and requiring any person \nwho may have a claim thereto, to appear before him and establish his claim within six months from the date of such \nproclamation. \n458. Procedure where no claimant appears within six months.—(1) If no person within such period \nestablishes his claim to such property, and if the person in whose possession such property was found is unable to \nshow that it was legally acquired by him, the Magistrate may  by order direct that such property shall be at the \ndisposal of the State Government  and may be sold by that Government and the proceeds of such sale shall be dealt \nwith in such manner as may be prescribed. \n(2) An appeal shall lie against any such order to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from convictions by \nthe Magistrate. \n459. Power to sell perishable property.—If the person entitled to the possession of such property is unknown \nor absent and the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if the Magistrate to whom its seizure is reported \nis of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, or that the value of such property is 1[less than five \nhundred rupees], the Magistrate may at any time direct it to be sold; and the provisions of sections 457 and 458 \nshall, as nearly as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale. \nCHAPTER XXXV \nIRREGULAR PROCEEDINGS \n460.
